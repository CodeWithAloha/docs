# Projects

## How do we choose projects?

We have a few criteria for projects that we take on:

1. The project must be open source and for the public good. We want to make sure that the work we do is available to everyone.
2. The project must be community-driven. We want to make sure that the community is involved in the process of building the project.
3. Each project must have a project lead. We want to make sure that there is someone who is responsible for the project and can answer questions about it.
4. Each project must also have a partner organization. We want to make sure that the project is being built for someone who needs it.

## What do we ask of project partners?

1. Be able to attend one of the weekly meetings at least once a month. We want to make sure that the project partner is engaged and is able to explain the _why_ about the project.
2. Provide a secondary point of contact. Just in case we need to reach someone when the primary point of contact is unavailable.

## What do we ask of project leads?

1. Be able to attend one of the weekly meetings at least once a month. We want to make sure that the project lead is engaged.
2. Be able to provide updates on the project. We want to make sure that the project lead is able to answer questions about the project.

> Note: We understand that life happens and that sometimes people are unable to attend meetings. We just ask that you let us know if you are unable to attend a meeting.

## Why would I want to be a project lead?

1. You get to work on a project that you are passionate about. You also get to decide project direction and priorities.
2. You can gain project management experience. You will be responsible for managing the project and the people working on it.
