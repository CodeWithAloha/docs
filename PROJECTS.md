# Projects

## How do we choose projects?

We have a few rule of thumbs for projects that we take on:

1. Projects are open source and for the public good
2. Project are community-driven and community-led (i.e. not for profit)
3. Project have a project lead - someone who is responsible for the project and can answer questions about it. This is usually the person who proposed the project, and has been involved in the project from the beginning
4. Project should have a partner organization - we don't want to work in a silo, and as primarily technologists we don't have all the answers

**Notes from @tyliec / Tyler Chong**

As a diatrabe, many come into the brigade with the idea of siphoning off volunteers to work on their for-profit projects, or want to use the brigade as a way to get free labor. We are not that. We are not a business, and we don't want to be a business. We are a community of volunteers who want to make a difference in our community.

The idea behind the projects we take on to the group are that the projects we work on impact everyone that lives here (essentially meaning that all the projects have some government tie-in, as "government" is the body that we as a society collectively decide to live under). Other organizations have reached out for work on their potential project ideas, but the usual disonnect is that non-profits / private entities conceptually do not have to serve everyone - and oftentimes the projects they propose do not.

However, there's no silver bullet here. The projects we take on will almost always be a blend of idealism (multiple generations impact & serving everyone that lives here) and the practical (short term, exciting impact for a select community). I like to think we steer the group towards the former rather than the latter, but that comes with it's own sets of challenges (low engagement since projects are typically less "exciting", longer running project timelines, ...etc). All that to say that running these projects are hard, and should not be taken lightly.

## What do we ask of project partners?

1. Be able to attend one of the meetings at least once a month. We want to make sure that the project partner is engaged and is able to explain the _why_ about the project.
2. Provide a secondary point of contact. Just in case we need to reach someone when the primary point of contact is unavailable.

## What do we ask of project leads?

1. Be able to attend one of the weekly meetings at least once a month. We want to make sure that the project lead is engaged.
2. Be able to provide updates on the project. We want to make sure that the project lead is able to answer questions about the project.

> Note: We understand that life happens and that sometimes people are unable to attend meetings. We just ask that you let us know if you are unable to attend a meeting.

## Why would I want to be a project lead?

1. You get to work on a project that you are passionate about. You also get to decide project direction and priorities.
2. You can gain project management experience. You will be responsible for managing the project and the people working on it.

## Recognizing Project Volunteers

A list of project volunteers are recognized on the [group's website](https://codewithaloha.org/). This list is updated automatically in a few different ways:

1. If you are a member of the Code With Aloha GitHub organization, and have contributed to a project listed in the [`REPOSITORIES_NAMES`](https://github.com/CodeWithAloha/website/blob/834177a0792f0d362bfc101dc38511b769ad8a49/.github/workflows/contributors.yml#L12) array in the [website repository](https://github.com/codewithaloha/website), you will be automatically added to the list of contributors.
1. For non-GitHub contributors (e.g. non-technical contributors), you can be added to the list as well. `CodeWithAloha` supports the [All Contributors specification](https://allcontributors.org/), and you can be added to the list by adding a comment to the issue or pull request that you contributed to. For example, if you contributed to the `CodeWithAloha/website` repository, you can add a comment to the issue or pull request that you contributed to with the following message: `@all-contributors please add @yourusername for [type of contribution]`. The bot will then add you to the list of contributors.
