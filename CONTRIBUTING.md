# Code for Hawaii Contribution Guidelines

> Note: Much of this document is adapted from [Code for Pittsburgh's Contribution Guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BWJCNm75PFfeFGTthl4zymMmfcdTQ46ZcJGQAgEiYhM/edit?usp=sharing). Thanks Code for Pittsburgh!

These are a set of guidelines for Code for Hawaii contributors. These guidelines aren’t hard and fast rules: if you think you have a good reason for bending one or more of these guidelines, talk with us about it! But generally speaking, following these not only make Code for Hawaii run more smoothly; it builds trust and opens opportunities for contributors to take on more advanced or engaging tasks. Conversely, repeated disregard for these guidelines may limit collaborative opportunities.

1. Make sure you assign yourself to your chosen issue on GitHub. This helps us know who’s doing what and signals to everyone else not to work on it unless they speak with you first.

2. If you want to help with a task someone else is already working, message them about it and get their approval first. We encourage collaboration, but it’s important that it’s actually collaborative! Two people developing competing scripts for the same task is confusing and can irk some people.

3. If you’re working on a task and you’re not sure how to proceed, ask for help! We’re all here to learn and help each other out. If you’re not sure who to ask, message the group on Slack.

4. If using Github, add a link to your branch/fork in the task, and commit and push your latest updates at the end of a work session. This helps us keep track of progress and see how your code is developing. And regularly publishing commits is also good practice in general.

5. Choose tasks you’re confident you can do between meetings. We like to keep things moving at a reasonable pace, so choose tasks you feel you can complete between regular meetings (i.e., within about two weeks). If you’d like to do a task but find it’s too large to do in the given timeframe, talk with us and we can look into breaking it down into smaller sub-tasks.

6. If you run into obstacles, let us know as soon as possible. Whether the task is turning out to be more complicated than you thought or something else came up that prevents you from completing it, please let us know when you can so that we can adjust or reassign the task.

7. When you finish a task, consider adding follow-up issues. This isn’t required, but makes things easier for the team. Since you worked on the task last, you probably know best what next needs done, and saves the rest of us time figuring it out later.

8. Constructive feedback is always welcome. Code for Hawaii runs better the more we’re informed of ways to improve. Just remember to word things politely and be open to discussion.
