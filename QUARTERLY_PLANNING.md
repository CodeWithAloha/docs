# Quarterly Planning Agenda

As a brigade, we should meet quarterly to plan our activities for the next quarter. This is a time to reflect on what we've done, what we've learned, and what we want to do next. This is also a time to check in with our ongoing projects and make sure they're on track.

A discussion post should be created to plan for and accept feedback prior to the meeting ([example](https://github.com/orgs/CodeWithAloha/discussions/5)). The discussion post should include a proposed agenda, and a call for any additional agenda items.

Sample Proposed Agenda:

1. Health check current ongoing projects
1. Figure out the meeting hosts for the next quarter (3 months)
1. Retrospective on brigade activities
1. Plan for the next quarter
