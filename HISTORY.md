# History

Code for Hawaii was officially founded in 2012 by [Burt Lum](https://twitter.com/burtlo) and a few others during the initial phase of [Code for America Brigades](https://web.archive.org/web/20210510151613/https://www.codeforamerica.org/blog/2012/08/23/introducing-the-brigade-captains-program/). The group was a [Code for America Brigade](https://brigade.codeforamerica.org/brigade/code-for-hawaii) and was a member of the [Code for America Network](https://www.codeforamerica.org/network/). In 2023, the group changed its name to Code with Aloha and exists under the [Alliance of Civic Technologists](https://www.civictechnologists.org/).
