Code with Aloha (formerly Code for Hawaii) is a volunteer-driven community organization. We are a group of developers, designers, data geeks, and citizen activists who use creative technology to solve civic and social problems. We do this by connecting government and community leaders with volunteer technologists.

## Mission

- Build with, not for. We are a community of people who are passionate about helping others. We are here to support each other and build together.
- Nobody is coming to save us. It's up to us to impact our community and drive change. We are the ones we've been waiting for. We are the change that we seek.
- We are a community of action. We are not here to talk about problems. We are here to solve them. We are not here to complain about the way things are. We are here to make things the way they should be.
